I am a security student focused on web, API, and Android security, as well as programming. I stated hunting of vulnerabilities on HackerOne, where I enjoy putting my rookie skills to the test

think of it as a treasure hunt, but the treasure is a bounty and the traps are real!

In my free time, I am writing a GitBook on GraphQL security vulnerabilities
-> because who doesnâ€™t love a good bedtime story about data leaks and injection attacks?
